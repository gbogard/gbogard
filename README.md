Thanks for stopping by!

**ðŸ‘‹ My name is Guillaume Bogard, I am a programmer with an appeal for statically-typed languages, functional programming and distributed systems.**

I code mostly in Rust lately, but I have a strong commercial Scala experience and am interested in statically-typed languages in general. 
I'm interested in languages and paradigms that make programs safer by design, and a strong believer in the "make illegal states unrepresentable" mantra.

My Github profile is not very active, but I have few articles and videos available on my [website](https://guillaumebogard.dev). It also has
the slides for the talks I gave at various events.

I'm currently working on a web-scale crawler for the [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com) search engine (implemented in Rust), 
and I'm also building [Duty Duck](https://github.com/duty-duck/duty-duck), a monitoring and incident management platform (also in Rust, but not quite ready yet).

Wanna chat? [Find me on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gbogard.bsky.social) and talk to me about Rust, Scala, functional programming, databases,
theme parks, or anything else!
